This project provides an end-to-end implementation of Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) for financial risk management. These are standard tools used by quantitative analysts, portfolio managers, and financial institutions to measure and control downside risk.

VaR answers the question: What is the maximum expected loss over a given time horizon at a certain confidence level?

For example: If a portfolio has a 1-day 95% VaR of ₹10 lakh, it means there’s a 5% chance of losing more than ₹10 lakh in a day.

CVaR (also called Expected Shortfall) is the expected loss given that the loss is beyond the VaR.

VaR only tells you how bad things could get up to a threshold. CVaR tells you how bad it actually gets beyond that threshold—so it captures tail risk better.
