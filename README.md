# Var-and-CVar-Risk-Modelling

VaR answers the question: What is the maximum expected loss over a given time horizon at a certain confidence level?

For example: If a portfolio has a 1-day 95% VaR of ₹10 lakh, it means there’s a 5% chance of losing more than ₹10 lakh in a day.

CVaR (also called Expected Shortfall) is the expected loss given that the loss is beyond the VaR.

VaR only tells you how bad things could get up to a threshold. CVaR tells you how bad it actually gets beyond that threshold—so it captures tail risk better.
